		<h1>HLP and Displacement: An Interactive Video Experience</h1>
		<p>Housing, land, and property (HLP) issues are among the most pressing challenges faced by humanitarian practitioners in displacement scenarios. In this interactive-video course, learners will step into the shoes of CCCM and Shelter practitioners tasked with addressing issues such as tenure verification (due diligence), property restitution for returnees and women’s access to land rights.  Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or new to the field, this interactive experience will equip you with valuable knowledge and skills necessary to effectively address HLP issues in emergency response and beyond.
      The course is organised in four modules: HLP Fundamentals, Security of Tenure, Returns and Property Restitution and Women’s Access to Property.
Time to complete the 4 modules: app. 40 minutes</p>
